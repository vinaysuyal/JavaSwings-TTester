# JavaSwings-TTester
This project helps user test their typing speed in for a time period which suits them the best. There are text files
(numbered 1 to 8) provided within the project which act as sources for text. New text files can be added but in doing so the user 
must make it sure that the number assigned to the file is being fetched by the Software and therefore make appropriate changes in the program.
